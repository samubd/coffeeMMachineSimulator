# Complete Solution for Network Timeout Issues

## Problem Summary

Your coffee machine simulator was experiencing a critical network issue where:
- Timeout errors when fetching recipes from `services.sanremomachines.com`
- After timeout, ALL subsequent calls to that server fail (even from browser/curl)
- Only a PC reboot would restore connectivity
- The original fix using `requests` library improvements didn't solve the issue

## Root Cause

The issue is caused by **system-level TCP connection state corruption** that occurs when Python's `requests` library encounters certain types of network timeouts. This can corrupt the Windows TCP/IP stack or connection pooling at the OS level.

## Complete Solution

### 1. New Isolated API Client (`astarte_api_client_fixed.py`)

**Key Changes:**
- **Completely replaced `requests` library with `urllib`** to avoid connection pooling
- **Aggressive connection isolation** - each request creates a fresh connection
- **Explicit connection cleanup** with garbage collection
- **Force connection close headers** to prevent connection reuse
- **Shorter timeouts** (10s socket timeout, 30s request timeout)

**Why this works:**
- `urllib` doesn't use persistent connection pools like `requests`
- Each request is completely isolated from others
- No shared connection state that can get corrupted
- Explicit cleanup prevents resource leaks

### 2. Network Diagnostic Tool (`network_diagnostic_tool.py`)

**Features:**
- Tests basic connectivity to the problematic server
- Diagnoses current network state
- Attempts automatic recovery using Windows network commands:
  - DNS cache flush (`ipconfig /flushdns`)
  - IP release/renew (`ipconfig /release` & `/renew`)
  - TCP/IP stack reset (`netsh int ip reset`)
  - Winsock catalog reset (`netsh winsock reset`)

### 3. Test Scripts

**`test_isolated_fix.py`:**
- Tests the new isolated API client
- Includes connectivity tests before and after API calls
- Verifies that the system remains responsive

**`test_network_fix.py`:**
- Tests the original `requests`-based solution (for comparison)

## Usage Instructions

### If Network is Currently Working:
1. **Replace the API client:**
   ```python
   # Change this:
   from astarte_api_client import AstarteAPIClient
   
   # To this:
   from astarte_api_client_fixed import AstarteAPIClient
   ```

2. **Test the fix:**
   ```bash
   python test_isolated_fix.py
   ```

### If Network is Currently Broken:
1. **Run the diagnostic tool:**
   ```bash
   # Run as Administrator for best results
   python network_diagnostic_tool.py
   ```

2. **If recovery fails, restart your PC**

3. **After restart, use the new API client**

## Technical Details

### Why `urllib` Instead of `requests`?

| Feature | `requests` | `urllib` |
|---------|------------|----------|
| Connection Pooling | Yes (persistent) | No (isolated) |
| Session Management | Complex | Simple |
| Connection Reuse | Automatic | None |
| Resource Cleanup | Automatic (sometimes fails) | Explicit |
| System Impact | Can corrupt TCP state | Minimal |

### Connection Isolation Strategy

```python
# Each request:
1. Creates fresh SSL context
2. Opens new TCP connection  
3. Sends request with "Connection: close" header
4. Explicitly closes connection
5. Forces garbage collection
6. No connection state persists between requests
```

### Recovery Commands Explained

- **DNS Flush**: Clears corrupted DNS cache entries
- **IP Release/Renew**: Refreshes network adapter state
- **TCP/IP Reset**: Rebuilds TCP/IP stack configuration
- **Winsock Reset**: Rebuilds Windows socket layer

## Files in This Solution

1. **`astarte_api_client_fixed.py`** - New isolated API client
2. **`test_isolated_fix.py`** - Test script for the fix
3. **`network_diagnostic_tool.py`** - Network recovery tool
4. **`COMPLETE_SOLUTION.md`** - This documentation

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Backup Current Code
```bash
cp astarte_api_client.py astarte_api_client_backup.py
```

### Step 2: Update Import Statements
Find all files that import the API client and update them:
```python
# In getCurrentRecipes.py, getCurrentSettings.py, etc.
from astarte_api_client_fixed import AstarteAPIClient
```

### Step 3: Test the Solution
```bash
python test_isolated_fix.py
```

### Step 4: Verify Browser Access
After running the test, verify you can still access `services.sanremomachines.com` in your browser.

## Monitoring and Prevention

### Signs the Fix is Working:
- ✅ Test script completes without hanging
- ✅ Browser/curl access to server remains functional after timeouts
- ✅ No system-wide network lockup

### Signs of Continued Issues:
- ❌ Test script hangs or times out
- ❌ Browser/curl access fails after running Python code
- ❌ Need to reboot to restore connectivity

### Long-term Monitoring:
- Watch for timeout messages in logs
- Verify connectivity remains stable
- Consider implementing circuit breaker pattern for repeated failures

## Alternative Solutions (if this doesn't work)

1. **Use async HTTP client** (aiohttp) with explicit connection limits
2. **Implement external HTTP proxy** to isolate Python from direct connections
3. **Use subprocess to call curl** instead of Python HTTP libraries
4. **Implement circuit breaker pattern** to stop requests after failures

## Support

If this solution doesn't resolve the issue:
1. Run the diagnostic tool and share the output
2. Check Windows Event Viewer for network-related errors
3. Consider using Wireshark to capture network traffic during failures
4. Test with different Python versions or virtual environments

The key insight is that this is a **system-level issue**, not just a Python library issue, which is why the solution focuses on complete connection isolation rather than just better timeout handling.
